# Using Docker with cve-services

## Security Considerations

The cve-services docker container contains a MongoDB instance that doesn't require authentication. If this container is exposed to the public internet it may allow unauthorised actors to modify data stored in the database.

## Setup for Local Development

Use the following steps to build and run cve-services (Node.js app
and Mongo) in docker containers.  Note that the current configurations
are set to run the services in development or staging (testing instance) mode. Note that these commands
must be run from the `docker/` directory.

The docker setup uses an environment defined in `docker/.docker-env.example`
but `docker-compose` looks for this file at `docker/.docker-env`.  The
`docker/.docker-env` file is ignored by our `.gitignore`. This is a
safeguard against developers committing changes to their local docker
environment.

## Setup for Local Penetration Testing

1. Change to the "staging" branch (this branch is used for the public testing instance):
  `git checkout staging`

2. Create your environment file if it doesn't already exist:
  `cp .docker-env.staging-example .docker-env`

3. Run the containers (this will also build the cveawg container from the included Dockerfile):
  `docker-compose up`

4. Populate mongoDB with test data included in "datadump/pre-population/":
  `docker-compose exec cveawg npm run populate:stage`

5. Retrieve an API Key (secret) for a test user that is stored in "user-secret.txt"
  `docker-compose exec cveawg cat user-secret.txt | grep admin2` \
  Should return: {"username":"admin2@mitre.org","secret":"API_KEY"}

6. Before running curl commands to test the API, you can create a configuration file with the values of HTTP headers. The examples below require a configuration file. (If you do not wish to create a configuration file, then you can instead modify each example so that all headers are entered separately on the command line, e.g., `-H "CVE-API-ORG: mitre" -H "CVE-API-USER: admin2@mitre.org"` (etc.). Such a command line has an https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/214.html weakness.) If you are using Bash on Linux, then you can type the following (except replace aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa with the correct 36-character API Key from step 5):
```
export CURL_CVE_CONFIG=$HOME/.curl-cve-config
touch $CURL_CVE_CONFIG
chmod 600 $CURL_CVE_CONFIG
/bin/echo -H \"CVE-API-ORG: mitre\" >> $CURL_CVE_CONFIG
/bin/echo -H \"CVE-API-USER: admin2@mitre.org\" >> $CURL_CVE_CONFIG
/bin/echo -H \"CVE-API-KEY: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\" >> $CURL_CVE_CONFIG
/bin/echo -H \"Content-type: application/json\" >> $CURL_CVE_CONFIG
/bin/echo -s >> $CURL_CVE_CONFIG
/bin/echo -S >> $CURL_CVE_CONFIG
```

7. Use curl to test the API's ability to show CVE IDs that exist in the running CVE Services:
  `curl -K $CURL_CVE_CONFIG http://localhost:3000/api/cve-id`

## Try It Out Further

   Use curl to retrieve organization information:
  `curl -K $CURL_CVE_CONFIG http://localhost:3000/api/org`

## To use curl to add a CNA

  `curl -K $CURL_CVE_CONFIG -X POST \
     --data-binary '{"name": "Example Corporation","short_name": "exampleCorp"}' \
     http://localhost:3000/api/org`

## To shell into the web app server

  `docker-compose exec cveawg /bin/sh`

## Using Mongo Express

You can use [Mongo Express](https://github.com/mongo-express/mongo-express)
(a mongo web UI) to view mongo from your browser.
To start Mongo Express you can start it with the following command:

  `docker run --network docker_cve-services -e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_SERVER=docdb -p 8081:8081 mongo-express`

You can use Mongo Express to view the Mongo data by using the
following URL and viewing the *cve_dev or cve_stage* databases:

  <http://localhost:8081/>
