    "description": "cve-schema specifies the CVE JSON record format. This is the blueprint for a rich set of JSON data that can be submitted by CVE Numbering Authorities (CNAs) and Authorized Data Publishers (ADPs) to describe a CVE record. Some examples of CVE record data include CVE ID number, affected product(s), affected version(s), and public references. While those specific items are required when assigning a CVE, there are many other optional data in the schema that can be used to enrich CVE records for community benefit. Learn more about the CVE program at [the official website](https://cve.mitre.org). This CVE JSON record format is defined using JSON Schema. Learn more about JSON Schema [here](https://json-schema.org/).",
